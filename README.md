Tentative stages:
1. Data preprocessing
The data set needs to be preprocessed to ensure that it is clean, complete, and in a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. 
This could involve tasks such as data cleaning, data normalization, feature selection, and feature engineering.

2. Model development
The next step is to develop machine learning models using the preprocessed data. 
This could involve using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, K-nearest neighbors or Gaussian Naive Bayes, to predict breast cancer diagnosis.

3. Model evaluation
Once the models have been developed, they need to be evaluated to determine their accuracy. 
This could involve using techniques such as cross-validation, ROC curves, or confusion matrices to assess the models' ability to predict breast cancer outcomes.



Content of the repository:
This repository has 3 files: breast-cancer.csv, EDA.ipynb and code.ipynb.

The breast-cancer.csv is the dataset file downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset

The EDA.ipynb is an EDA report with codes. It shows overview of the dataset such as statistical summary, distribution and correlationship and so on.

The code.ipynb is the coding file to clean data, create machine learning models, make predictions and evaluate models' performances.
